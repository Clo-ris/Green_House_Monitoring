# Green_House_Monitoring
Greenhouse Microclimate Monitoring system, a project that created to track and maintain optimal environmental condition within greenhouses. 

**How It WorksðŸ¦¾**

By utilizing IoT technology, the system integrated DHT 11 sensor to collect data, which will displayed on I2C LCD screen for easy reference. The system also integrates with LED lights and piezo buzzer to provide alerts to users. It is programmed with Arduino IDE and uses ThingSpeak for online data visualization. With this two software, the system able to allow uses to remote monitoring and analyze the greenhouse conditions. The main goals are to maintain a stable climate for plants, automate monitoring process, and improve the management of greenhouse. Overall, IoT technology enhances monitoring accuracy and supports quick decision-making for agriculture.
